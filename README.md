### Overview
Due to the increased production of original films by major companies, Microsoft has requested that we assess the movie industry's outlook and provide recommendations before making any decisions. Our evaluation involved using return on investment as a metric to measure the profitability of specific genres. We also analyzed the best performing studios at the movie box office and examined the most popular genres with high viewer votes to derive our conclusions.

### Business Problem
For Microsoft, the key challenge in venturing into the original video content space is devising a strategy to produce content that can compete with established rivals like Netflix and Amazon and entice and retain audiences. To achieve this, Microsoft will need to set itself apart by:

Making substantial investments in content development, talent recruitment, and marketing. Developing a thorough understanding of audience preferences and trends. Determining a monetization approach that balances the expenses of content creation with revenue sources such as advertising or subscriptions.

My analysis was based on three crucial factors:

* Determining the most prevalent genre.
* Examining the correlation between production budget and return on investment.
* What are the best performing studios at the movie box office?

#### Data Understanding
There were four data sets provided each containing different data. The data sets were:
1. Box Office Mojo.
2. IMDB.
3. TheMovieDB.
4. The Numbers

This analysis utilizes datasets acquired from three movie websites, namely Box Office Mojo, The Numbers, and TMDB.

* The first dataset, bom.movie_gross.csv, has five columns comprising of movie titles, studios, financial incomes both domestic and foreign and the release year.

* The second dataset, tn.movie_budgets.csv, contains information on released films, including their names, release dates, and financial data such as production budget and worldwide gross. The key variable for this dataset is the ROI, and the monetary data columns are the primary reason for selecting this dataset.

* The third dataset, tmdb.movies.csv, contains genre codes, original language of the movies, original movie titles, popularity metrics, dates in which the movies were released, and information on the votes. I used this dataset to map genre codes to genre names obtained from the same website so that I could see which genres are more trending.
#### Data Analysis
The analysis phase focuses on exploring the relationships in the previously prepared data to help make an analysis of the given data. 

#### Conclusions
This analysis leads to the following conclusions for the types of films that are the best performing in the box office:

1. Microsoft could potentially obtain intellectual property rights from top movie studios to enter the film industry. However, since Microsoft has no prior experience in film production, it may face challenges in terms of adapting to the industry's unique characteristics.

2. The weak positive correlation between production budget and return on investment suggests that higher production budgets do not necessarily guarantee higher returns. Therefore, Microsoft may need to carefully manage its production costs and investments to ensure a profitable return on investment.

3. The strong positive correlation between worldwide gross and production budget implies that higher-budget films tend to have a wider reach and higher box office revenue. As such, Microsoft may need to consider investing in high-budget productions to maximize its revenue potential.

4. The insight that 'Horror' and 'Music' genres are more likely to have a higher return on investment while 'Action' and 'Adventure' genres are the top most popular genres suggests that Microsoft could focus on producing films in these genres to increase its profitability.

In conclusion, Microsoft could potentially enter the film industry by obtaining intellectual property rights from top movie studios. However, to succeed in the industry, Microsoft will need to carefully manage its production costs and investments, focus on high-budget productions, and consider producing films in popular and profitable genres such as Horror, Music, Action, and Adventure.

#### RECOMMENDATION
1. Conduct thorough market research: Before entering the film industry, Microsoft should conduct comprehensive market research to gain a deep understanding of the industry's unique characteristics, trends, and consumer preferences. This research will help Microsoft make informed decisions about production costs, investment strategies, and genre preferences.

2. Partner with experienced film producers: Given Microsoft's lack of experience in the film industry, partnering with experienced film producers can help overcome some of the challenges in adapting to the industry's unique characteristics. These partnerships can help Microsoft gain valuable insights and expertise in film production, marketing, and distribution.

3. Develop a clear investment strategy: Microsoft should develop a clear investment strategy that balances production costs with potential returns on investment. This strategy should consider factors such as genre preferences, production budget, and revenue potential.

4. Focus on high-budget productions: The strong positive correlation between worldwide gross and production budget suggests that Microsoft should focus on high-budget productions to maximize its revenue potential. However, Microsoft should carefully manage its production costs and investments to ensure a profitable return on investment.

5. Consider producing films in popular and profitable genres: The analysis suggests that Microsoft could focus on producing films in popular and profitable genres such as Horror, Music, Action, and Adventure to increase its profitability. However, Microsoft should also consider consumer preferences and market trends before making genre-specific investments.

6. Protect intellectual property rights: To enter the film industry, Microsoft may need to obtain intellectual property rights from top movie studios. Microsoft should take steps to protect its intellectual property rights to avoid potential legal disputes and safeguard its investments in the film industry.
