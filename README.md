### Overview
Due to the increased production of original films by major companies, Microsoft has requested that we assess the movie industry's outlook and provide recommendations before making any decisions. Our evaluation involved using return on investment as a metric to measure the profitability of specific genres. We also analyzed the best performing studios at the movie box office and examined the most popular genres with high viewer votes to derive our conclusions.

### Business Problem
For Microsoft, the key challenge in venturing into the original video content space is devising a strategy to produce content that can compete with established rivals like Netflix and Amazon and entice and retain audiences. To achieve this, Microsoft will need to set itself apart by:

Making substantial investments in content development, talent recruitment, and marketing. Developing a thorough understanding of audience preferences and trends. Determining a monetization approach that balances the expenses of content creation with revenue sources such as advertising or subscriptions.

My analysis was based on three crucial factors:

* Determining the most prevalent genre.
* Examining the correlation between production budget and return on investment.
* What are the best performing studios at the movie box office?

#### Data Understanding
There were four data sets provided each containing different data. The data sets were:
1. Box Office Mojo.
2. IMDB.
3. TheMovieDB.
4. The Numbers

This analysis utilizes datasets acquired from three movie websites, namely Box Office Mojo, The Numbers, and TMDB.

* The first dataset, bom.movie_gross.csv, has five columns comprising of movie titles, studios, financial incomes both domestic and foreign and the release year.

* The second dataset, tn.movie_budgets.csv, contains information on released films, including their names, release dates, and financial data such as production budget and worldwide gross. The key variable for this dataset is the ROI, and the monetary data columns are the primary reason for selecting this dataset.

* The third dataset, tmdb.movies.csv, contains genre codes, original language of the movies, original movie titles, popularity metrics, dates in which the movies were released, and information on the votes. I used this dataset to map genre codes to genre names obtained from the same website so that I could see which genres are more trending.
#### Data Analysis
The analysis phase focuses on exploring the relationships in the previously prepared data to determine.

#### Conclusions
